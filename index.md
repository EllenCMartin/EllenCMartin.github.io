# optional portfolio section ------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a portfolio showcasing your work and organize your portfolio's items into a custom layout, all without adding any CSS. In addition, you must 1) create an HTML file in the_includes folder for each project with the text you'd like to display, and 2) create a YAML file in the _data folder describing the order in which each project should be shown and categorized. See `/includes/example.html` and `/_data/work.yml` for examples.

portfolio: work # the heading for your portfolio and title of your YAML file
portfolio_description: I am a wildlife biologist with a special interest in migration, spatial population synchrony, and large data management. I am working as a PhD with the Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, investigating patterns across life history characteristics and patterns of synchrony. In particular, I love thinking about these questions with avian species. I received my MS in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University in the lab of Paul F. Doherty, Jr., where I designed the first design-based survey of lowland and upland breeding shorebirds in interior Alaska on military lands. Before that, I was an undergraduate at The College of William and Mary studying Biology and Chinese language. Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about biking, skiing, growing plants, and music.

# optional CTA section --------------------------------------------------

# By declaring these variables, you can include a CTA section.

### ** STATEMENT HERE.  
  
**Bio**             I am a wildlife biologist with a special interest in migration, spatial population synchrony, and large data management. I am working as a PhD with the Centre for Biodiversity Dynamics, investigating patterns across life history characteristics and patterns of synchrony. In particular, I love thinking about these questions with avian species. I received my MS in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology from Colorado State University in the lab of Paul F. Doherty, Jr., where I designed the first design-based survey of lowland and upland breeding shorebirds in interior Alaska on military lands. Before that, I was an undergraduate at The College of William and Mary studying Biology and Chinese language. Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about biking, skiing, growing plants, and music.  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but maybe aren't so familiar with web development.
  

The default layout of **hello** is a streamlined single page with three major customizable sections: a required "about" section, an optional portfolio, and an optional CTA. Using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) variables declared by in the config and index files, **hello** offers an easy-to-use design where all customizations necessary for a basic personal website can be written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  


**hello** is adapted from [Twenty](https://html5up.net/twenty), a responsive, mobile-friendly theme by HTML5 Up.
